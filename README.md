The simai auto-sorter was made to automate the extracting, sorting and conversion of maichart converts from another repo. All it requires are the said zip files from the repo to be placed inside the 'ZIP Inputs' folder and it will spit out the .ADX files into the 'ADX Files' folder.

Link to said Maichart convert repo: https://github.com/I21b/Maicharts-in-Zip

How to use:
- Start program to create necessary directories ('ADX Files' and 'ZIP Imports'), or just make them yourself. Since these folders whould be in the same directory as where your file is located, I recommend putting the Python file in a dedicated folder.
- Drop zip files downloaded from repo above into the 'ZIP Imports' folder.
- Start the script and watch it work.

Since I just started coding in Python about 5 days ago from time of last README update, I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way of doing things. Feel free to suggest any changes or improvements I can make to the script. Emjoy :)

P.S., another unintended function of my code is as a bedtime story. This, I was made aware of by a friend of mine.
